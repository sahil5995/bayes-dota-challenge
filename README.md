This is the [task](TASK.md).

Additional information
----------------------

Due to limited time of 2 hours, few of the things are missing in the code. Would like to add below mentioned things if given more time:

* Addition the test cases for all the layers, including controller, service and dao etc.
* Would like to do the better mapping between tables.
* Creation of Java docs.
* Little better approach for strategy pattern used in the code.
