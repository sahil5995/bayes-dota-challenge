==========

This is the [task](TASK.md).

Any additional information.

* Due to limited time of 2 hours, few of the things are missing in the code. Would like to add below mentioned things if given more time:

1) Addition the test cases for all the layers, including controller, service and dao etc.
2) Would like to do the better mapping between tables.
3) Creation of Java docs.
4) Little better approach for strategy pattern used in the code.
